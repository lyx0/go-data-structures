### Linked list vs Array

### Array:
- In an Array each box is indexed and is physically next to each other.

Example:
- Go to the 4th box and change 15 to 16

### Linked list:
- In a Linked list each box contains the value, and the address of the next element in the list.
- Linked lists don't have to be physically next to each other

Example:
- Go to the head, follow down the path to the 4th box, then change 15 to 16.
